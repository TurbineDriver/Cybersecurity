# Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity Class


In this class we have covered a plethora of topics. The files in this repository are from work we did with Linux and Azure Cloud Network construction. 

In the "Linux" folder you will find two Bash scrips. One was written to find a cheating Roulette Dealer and the other is a script to easily find the name of a Dealer by game and time.

In the "Diagrams" folder there are two screenshots of Network Diagrams. The one labeled "Cloud Network" is a diagram of a network we built and learned about firewall configuration. The diagram labeled ELK Network is the same as the first except we added an ELK server and a network peering function in order to monitor our original network.

In the folder labeled "Ansible" you will find three ansible playbook files that we used in an ansible container we created. One configures the Docker application the other two were used to install and configure the Filebeat and Metricbeat applications.

Finally, in the ELK Deployment README.md you will find a comprehensive descripton of the steps and details of our ELK deployment.
